                  <p> Everyone knows this man, maybe not for his name or his face but his magnificent compositions. Ennio Morricone has been one of the best musician of our decade and peronally my favorite film composer. Here's my tribute web page for him
                      <br>Morricone received five Oscar nominations, the first in 1979 for the soundtrack of the film "Days of Heaven" by Terrence Malick, then follow that for "Mission" by Roland Joffé, 1986, "The Untouchables "Brian De Palma in 1987," Bugsy "Barry Lavison in 1992 and" Malena "by Giuseppe Tornatore in 2001. <br>
                      But Hollywood never gave him the official one, at least until 2007 when Clint Eastwood gave him a special Academy award for lifetime achievement by saying: "This Oscar is for his magnifient and mutifaceted contributions to the art of film music". 

He has written music for more than 500 motion pictures and TV series and Morricone's music has been used in more than 60 award-winning films. Read here about his filmography.

                    <br>The first soundtrack was for the movie “A fistful of dollars”, which became so popular that Director Leone never gave up Morricone’s work for his spaghetti westerns movies.<br>
